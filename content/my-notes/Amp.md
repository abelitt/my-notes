The amp plugin is an Abelton Audio effect that was created in Abelton to simulate guitar amps like vox or fender amps. 

Although very simple, it provides all that's needed to turn your guitar into some of the best amps that have ever existed. 

Of course, there are going to be better amp plugins out there, including Amplitube which I'll cover eventually in this, but this is certainly not to be overlooked.

Might need to reduce the size of some of these videos now. This is going to get out of hand otherwise, or better yet, upload them to youtube perhaps?

Either way, the amp plugin has 7 different modes:

- Clean
- Boost
- Blues
- Rock
- Lead 
- Heavy 
- Bass

Each serve a different purpose for different ways in which a guitar should sound. With Clean giving some EQ to the sound with little distortion while lead goes full metal with every effect under the sun on it. 

The gain provides a input volume, before you've applied all the effects

Bass middle and Treble provides controls for different sections of the frequency, with bass being lower end, middle being the middle of the frequencies and treble being the higher ends. This allows for you to, for example, emphisis the high strings on your guitar, or thicken the lower strings.

Presence is still an unknown to me but I think it is possibly like a dry and wet for for your bass, middle and treble? Basically like how much do you want the plugin to effect the bass, middle and treble. 

The volume is the output volume, after you have applied all the effects. 

The dry and wet provide control over how much of the plugin sound you want to be outputted compared to your input sound. This allows you to, for example, allow in 60% of your input sound and 40% of the output sound. Simply changes the character. Think of it like audio opacity when adding images. How invisible do you want this sound to be.
